Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology

   this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude in
   terms of topics is allowed, but there are posts and topics that are
   unsuitable for this mailing list.  This document defines the charter
   for the IETF discussion list and explains its scope.

   This document obsoletes RFC3005 and updates RFC3683.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list [IETF-DISCUSS] furthers the development and
   specification of Internet technology through the general discussion
   of technical, procedural, operational and other topics for which no
   dedicated mailing lists exists.  As this is the most general IETF
   mailing list, considerable latitude in terms of topics is allowed.
   However, there are posts and topics that are unsuitable for this
   mailing list.  This document defines the charter for the IETF
   discussion list and explains its scope.

   The IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL] applies to discussions on the IETF
   discussion list and all other IETF mailing lists, and requires
   conformance with the IETF Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the
   Anti-Harassment Policy [RFC7776], among others.

   This document obsoletes [RFC3005], documenting the use of other
   mailing lists for discussions that used to be in scope for the IETF
   discussion list, referring to applicable policies such as the
   Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the Anti-Harassment Policy
   [RFC7776], and clarifying moderation procedures.  It also updates
   part of Section 1 of [RFC3683], which copies the list of
   "inappropriate postings" from [RFC3005].  This list in [RFC3683] is
   hence updated by the new list in Section 2 below.

2.  Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   The IETF discussion list is meant for discussions for which a more
   appropriate list does not exist, such as discussions that do not fall
   within the scope of any working group, area, or other established
   list.  When discussions are started on the IETF discussion list for
   which such a venue does exist, they should be continued at that other
   venue as soon as this is pointed out.

   When no dedicated mailing list exists for a topic, it may be
   preferable to request the creation of one [NON-WG-LISTS] and announce
   the availability of the new list on the IETF discussion list and on
   other related lists, such as area lists, rather than discussing that
   topic on the IETF discussion list.

   Appropriate postings to the IETF discussion list include:

   *  Initial discussion of technical issues that are candidates for
      IETF work, but have not yet identified appropriate mailing lists.

   *  Questions and clarifications concerning practical aspects of IETF
      meetings, although most of these topics are better brought up on
      the discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS] or the attendee discussion list for a given IETF
      meeting.

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the IETF, IRTF, IAB or the Internet
      Society, although the IETF announcement list [IETF-ANNOUNCE] is
      the preferred list for these.

   *  Discussions of IETF direction, policy, and the standards process
      in general, when a more suitable list (such as the discussion list
      for IETF LLC administrative issues [ADMIN-DISCUSS], the IAB
      discussion list for architectural issues [ARCH-DISCUSS], a meeting
      attendees list, a process-oriented WG list, etc.) cannot be
      identified.

   These topics used to be in scope for the IETF discussion list, but
   have since moved to dedicated lists:

   *  Last Call discussions of documents now take place on the IETF Last
      Calls mailing list [LAST-CALLS].

   *  Discussion of IETF administrative policies now takes place on the
      discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS].

   Inappropriate postings include:

   *  Advertising and other unsolicited bulk e-mail

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical topics

   *  Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject, per the
      IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL]

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF.

3.  Moderation

   The IETF Chair appoints _Moderators_ (previously known as the
   "sergeant-at-arms") for the IETF discussion list that are empowered
   to restrict posting by a person, or to an email thread, when the
   content is inappropriate and represents a pattern of abuse.  They are
   encouraged to take into account the overall nature of the postings by
   an individual and whether particular postings are an aberration or
   typical.

   Moderation of the IETF discussion list, including the handling of any
   appeals, is to be guided by the IETF discussion list charter
   specified in Section 2, and the related guidance from Section 1 that
   applies to all mailing lists.  The moderators are intended to
   establish a self-moderation function on the community, by the
   community.  Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for
   moderator decisions (see below), the IETF Chair therefore should not
   appoint a moderator who is serving in such a role.  If a moderator is
   selected for the IESG or IAB, they will step down from the moderator
   team.

   Apart from appointing moderators, the IETF Chair should refrain from
   the day-to-day operation and management of the moderator team.  The
   moderator team will independently define, publish, and execute their
   roles according to a set of operating procedures [MOD-SOP] and abuse
   patterns [MOD-UPC].  The moderator team should reach out to the IETF
   Chair for any conflict resolution in a timely manner.

   Because a moderator serves at the discretion of the IETF Chair - even
   if the IETF Chair is not otherwise involved in the operation of the
   moderator team - any moderator decision can be appealed to the IETF
   Chair, per [RFC2026].  Decisions by the IETF Chair can be appealed to
   the IESG as whole, again per [RFC2026].

4.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
   undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
   process, per Section 3.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
