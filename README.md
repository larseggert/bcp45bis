* @mentions

Authors, AD, WG chairs, and document shepherd, please ensure that your GitHub notification settings are set such that you can participate promptly in discussions of issues and pull requests. For more information, please see [Configuring notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

## Issue Tracking
Questions and FYIs from the RFC Editor have been added as issues. Please provide your answers in the comments and use a label to indicate issue status:
* rfced - initial label of RFC Editor questions and FYIs (keep this label if the issue is still active).
* question - a follow-up question has been added to the issue discussion. Use @mention to identify the participant who should answer. 
* AD approval required - the resolution of the issue requires the AD to review and approve the change.
* editor-ready - the RFC Editor can update the document and/or close the issue based on the issue discussion.

Feel free to add new issues for new edits and questions. 

The editor will close the issue when it has been addressed either by accepting a pull request or simply closing the issue if no changes are needed.  

## Pull Requests
If you would like to submit changes, please create a pull request and identify one or more issues that the pull request closes in the comments. 

If the editor creates the PR, the editor will assign a reviewer for the PR and will expect feedback from the reviewer before merging the PR. 

For the ease of all reviewers, please do not use inline comments on pull requests.
